    "In Mehdi Benbiba's project, Zara Sales Analysis<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) she actually uses the same Kaggle dataset that we've chosen and explores univariate and bivariate relationships. Initially I was concerned about the project as it used the same dataset we had decided upon, the project itself was very different only showing correlational data between, at most, bivariate data. Although the data is informative and she does showcase correlational data, I don't think there are any huge takeaways or really a major focus of the data. \n",

    "In Mohamed Ibrahim's project, Sales Data Analysis<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) he analyzed sales data to uncover peak sales months, best-selling products, top revenue-generating cities, and more. The results of his project showed that Monday was the top selling day (annually), December was the top selling month, the most number of orders occurred at 7PM, and more. Although his research shows a lot of great content, there are a number of limitations with what is implicated. For example, the product mix he used was limited to electronic devices including batteries, headphones, and charging cables. Furthermore, when he analyzed the best-selling day of the week, he didn't aggregate the data over the period of the year and instead visualized it by day, month which is a duplicate of the visualization showcasing what the best-selling month was. Finally, he didn't particularly look into whether the outcome of the data was due to causation or simply correlation (i.e. if revenue was so high on Mondays because a ton of Mondays are holidays, etc). \n",

Although Nurkholiq showcases great insights by identifying the best and worst-case selling product, I think one way he could've taken this a step further would be identifying the reason for it being the best-selling or worst-selling product or discovering what made sales drop in the ensuing months of March. However, it is a great reference point for us to look at for more preliminary analyses. \n",

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Yes, one source of bias we identified is the fact that our dataset was web-scraped. This means that some Zara products may be missing because they were temporarily out of stock. Additionally, \"Promotion\" and \"Product Position\" can influence the \"Sales Volume,\" which can confound product attribute relationships and sales. Therefore, we have decided that we will first treat our results as correlational, keeping several categories such as \"Promotion\" and \"Section\" as controls.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Though the Zara dataset doesn't explicitly share personally identifiable information because it is product focused, we will not publish any raw URLs or full text content in the report. We will introduce certain findings from a high level instead, and exclude any  information that would not help us answer our research question.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"

Separate tasks will be assigned to people with each assignment and all teammates must agree with task assignments. Our team will check the list of current tasks and progress by checking GitHub issues.\n",
