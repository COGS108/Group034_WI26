Initially I was concerned about the project as it used the same dataset we had decided upon, the project itself was very different only showing correlational data between, at most, bivariate data.

The results of his project showed that Monday was the top selling day (annually), December was the top selling month, the most number of orders occurred at 7PM, and more. Although his research shows a lot of great content, there are a number of limitations with what is implicated. For example, the product mix he used was limited to electronic devices including batteries, headphones, and charging cables. Furthermore, when he analyzed the best-selling day of the week, he didn't aggregate the data over the period of the year and instead visualized it by day, month which is a duplicate of the visualization showcasing what the best-selling month was. Finally, he didn't particularly look into whether the outcome of the data was due to causation or simply correlation (i.e. if revenue was so high on Mondays because a ton of Mondays are holidays, etc). \n",

    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Yes, one source of bias we identified is the fact that our dataset was web-scraped. This means that we only get a snapshot in time of certain products. Additionally, product attributes such as NumImages and Description completeness will vary by the specific product types and price tiers. Unfortunately, this may introduce bias that affects price relationship, so we will be sure to treat findings as correlational. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Though the dataset doesn't explicitly share personally identifiable information because it is product focused, we will not publish any raw URLs or full text content in the report. We will introduce certain findings from a high level instead, and exclude any  information that would not help us answer our research question.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> Gender is considered to be a sensitive attribute especially in context for fashion. This may mean that there are  pricing differences with certain products, so we will be sure to check if model error differs across the female and male gender groups. Overall, we will mention these concerns in our final write up and do our best to evaluate price distributions by gender.\n",

    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> To examine the data for possible sources of bias, we will check for imbalances across attributes such as \"ProductBrand,\" \"Gender,\" and \"PrimaryColor\" because there may be certain brands that are dominating the dataset. We will also parse through our dataset to check for missing fields that may appear and consider controlling those attributes to see if our conclusions will change.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> We understand the importance of having clear visualizations, summary statistics, and reports, and we will use the appropriate ones for skewed price distributions. This is to avoid potential misleading interpretations driven by outliers, as fashion products have a wide range in numerical value for price. We will clearly define our definitions, such as predictability, and account for outliers to make sure our conclusions are not exaggerated.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> We will do our best to document how we analyze the data and any missing descriptions in the dataset. This will allow its reproducibility later on in case we re-run our results. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> In the case that we remove \"Gender\" from the equation, there are still other attributes that may still be impacted by gendered marketing. To clarify, this may mean that the model is guessing gender from other clues such as brand or description. We will interpret our results (especially those that related to gender) cautiously, mentioning that there amy be pricing patterns in the catalog to avoid suggesting that one gender's products are \"worth more.\"\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)\n",
    "> We can compute error metrics such as MAE and RMSE seperately for the respective Gender groups to see if there are differing performances. In the case where one group has a consistently higher error, we will document that limitation. Additionally, we will check if there is an imbalance or if different price ranges explain this.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We plan to report metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R^2 because each one is connected to a different harm such as large overpricing errors. Using baselines to compare (such as overall mean price) will help us contextualize our results. \n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    ">We will explain the decisions the models make clearly, using interpretable models such as Ridge regression. This will allow us to explain which attributes may be driving predictions. Brands and genders can be sensitive features and need to be justified and explanable should there be confusion. \n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> Because this model predicts price from the catalog attributes, not other features such as the quality or consumer behavior, prices may be influenced by factors not in the dataset. To account for this, our predictions will be treated as approximate, and we will include these limitations in our final project writeup. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> There may be the case that the model could be interpreted to justify discriminatory pricing, especially for gendered pricing. To account for this risk, we will clearly state that this model only reflects a catalog pattern for a specific segment of time, and is not concerned with \"fairness.\"\n"

    "* As a team, we will communicate through iMessages and respond to each other within 24 hours, or 6 hours if a deadline is approaching. We will schedule meetings as needed either virtually or in-person based on team members’ preference for that week. We will aim to meet weekly, but we will be flexible about rescheduling meetings.\n",
    "* Feedback should be given in a polite way, but still be straightforward. An example would be “I think X could be an issue because of Y. What do you think?”\n",
    "* When making decisions, we will aim to get a unanimous vote by compromising. If a unanimous vote is impossible, we will resort to taking the majority vote. Each member will have equal authority in each decision. If a teammate is not responsive when we need to make a decision, the teammate will not be able to participate in the vote unless they respond in time.\n",
    "* Team members will specialize in tasks, but always have the opportunity to help with other tasks with confirmation. Separate tasks will be assigned to people with each assignment and all teammates must agree with task assignments. Our team will check the list of current tasks and progress by checking GitHub issues.\n",
    "* We will make a plan and create deadlines based on assignments. We will update if plans ever change.\n",
    "* A struggling member should message the group chat as soon as they have difficulties that they believe might hinder their performance on a task. Another teammate with more expertise should step in and help, dividing the issue up with other knowledgeable teammates.\n",
    "* Expectations will be kept on a google doc."
