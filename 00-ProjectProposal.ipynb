The results of his project showed that Monday was the top selling day (annually), December was the top selling month, the most number of orders occurred at 7PM, and more. Although his research shows a lot of great content, there are a number of limitations with what is implicated. For example, the product mix he used was limited to electronic devices including batteries, headphones, and charging cables. Furthermore, when he analyzed the best-selling day of the week, he didn't aggregate the data over the period of the year and instead visualized it by day, month which is a duplicate of the visualization showcasing what the best-selling month was. Finally, he didn't particularly look into whether the outcome of the data was due to causation or simply correlation (i.e. if revenue was so high on Mondays because a ton of Mondays are holidays, etc). \n",

    "In this project, done by Nurkholiq Agani Hafid, he performed an analysis on DiCo (Dicoding Collection)<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)showcasing what the best-selling product was, what the worst-selling product was, what the demographic of the consumer base was, and more. Although Nurkholiq showcases great insights by identifying the best and worst-case selling product, I think one way he could've taken this a step further would be identifying the reason for it being the best-selling or worst-selling product or discovering what made sales drop in the ensuing months of March. However, it is a great reference point for us to look at for more preliminary analyses. \n",

    "Due to the previous projects we referenced above, it seems like the time of the year plays a big influence in sales volume which is why we expect it to have a large influence that may explain the variation in sales volume for Zara's retail dataset. Another feature we expect to have a large impact on the variation in sales volume is price because especailly today with how inflated prices are for clothing, it is almost certain that price has a huge impact on sales volume."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Yes, one source of bias we identified is the fact that our dataset was web-scraped. This means that some Zara products may be missing because they were temporarily out of stock. Additionally, \"Promotion\" and \"Product Position\" can influence the \"Sales Volume,\" which can confound product attribute relationships and sales. Therefore, we have decided that we will first treat our results as correlational, keeping several categories such as \"Promotion\" and \"Section\" as controls.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Though the Zara dataset doesn't explicitly share personally identifiable information because it is product focused, we will not publish any raw URLs or full text content in the report. We will introduce certain findings from a high level instead, and exclude any  information that would not help us answer our research question.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Zara dataset doesn't include personal information or data, but this information can still be considered as business-sensitive. For instance, the case competitors want to look at its promotions and catalog positionings. To mitigate this, we will restrict the access of our data to our team members only and may not upload any raw data unless the dataset permits us to (because our repo is public).\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "       \n",
    ">The data for \"Sales Volume\" may seem generalized at this moment because we do not know the specific marketing campaigns, inventories, and product placements Zara has done (potential ommited confounding variables). Variables such as \"Promotion\" can still be a confounder because a product may be driving high sales because of its higher visibility, or because of its independent attributes. We will try to mitigate this by controlling \"Promotion,\" \"Product Position,\" and \"Section,\" in our models and be careful about claiming relationships as casual. Confirmation bias may be possible when we choose to focus on \"interesting\" relationships, so to mitigate this, we will predefine main comparisons and report weak and strong relationships as we see them.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Our team will do our best to make sure our visualizations are clearly labeled and be straightforward with our summary statistics and reports. Sales data can be skewed in visualizations, so we will note this in the case our data appears visually exaggerated.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    ">We will keep our code and notebooks organized to ensure everyone working on this project is informed. Additionally, our meetings will allow us to make sure everyone is on the same page and is able to reproduce the same results from the same datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    ">Because our research question revolves around variation that happens in Sales Volume, we will analyze models with metrics like R^2. We will be careful to avoid tunneling on predictive accuracy in case it harms interpretability. \n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    ">We will avoid flowery and unclear language that could potentially complicate someone's understanding of our models. We will also focus on interpretable modeling. \n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    ">We will clearly state limitations such as correlations between variables such as \"Promotion\" and \"Product Position\" because the data from this webscrape may not be applicable to the time beyond its scrape. Our team expects to pick up on more potential biases as we work on the project, and we plan to document everything we see clearly. \n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    ">As mentioned before, there is a concern that a reader may interpret our assocations as causal, but we will frame our results as correlations and stray away from making prescriptive claims. We will also sign post the reader of these warnings in the beginning of our project. Otherwise, we do not currently predict any abusive uses of the model.\n"
